This folder is for the definition of models - a model, according to chat, "is a blueprint for a
 type of data your app works with."

"In Mongoose (and many other ORMs/ODMs), a model:

    Defines the shape of the data (fields, types)

    Connects to a MongoDB collection

    Gives you methods to interact with the database (e.g., .find(), .save(), .updateOne())"
