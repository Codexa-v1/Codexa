# You'll notice that I did not use .gitignore for node_modules - the reason is that there is an error in the code in one of the files, so I had to change it manually. This means that you do not have to type npm install when you clone the thing. If you decide to add node_modules to the .gitignore files, you will have to use npm install and you will run into the error that I had to fix.
