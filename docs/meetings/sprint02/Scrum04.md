## ðŸ—‚ Agenda Items

### ðŸ”¹ Recent Work
- **Kutlwano** â†’ Worked on authentication keys and drafted a deployment guide.  
- **Molemo** â†’ Focused on front- and backend integration, opened a PR into `main` with his and Ntobekoâ€™s work.  
- **Ntando** â†’ Tested the frontend of the application.  
- **Given** â†’ Updated project timeline, added new meeting minutes to the documentation site, updated repository `README`, and refined Trello board.  
- **Ntobeko** â†’ Integrated a weather API into the web app.  

### ðŸ”¹ Moving Forward
1. Frequent merging of related branches will be required.  
2. Web app must still be secured.  
3. End-to-end testing must begin (Playwright).  
4. Merge work into `main` ASAP to prepare for marking.  
5. Ensure backend works properly after merge, since deployment depends on `main`.  
6. Use **GitHub Issues** and **Trello** for bug tracking.  
7. Communicate clearly whenever branches are merged.  
8. Remove redundant branches from repo to avoid confusion.
