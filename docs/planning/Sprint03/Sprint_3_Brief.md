## âš¡ Sprint 3 Action Plan

1. **Testing** â€“ Increase test coverage, add CI/CD test docs.  
2. **Feature Demos** â€“ Implement tutor-requested features (VIP guests, vendor checks, budget tracking).  
3. **APIs** â€“ Strengthen endpoint coverage and reliability.  
4. **User Feedback** â€“ Document stakeholder sessions and tutor feedback integration.  
5. **Performance** â€“ Improve refresh times, auto-reload features.  
6. **Documentation** â€“ Update GitHub docs with testing strategy, API & DB schemas.  
7. **Methodology** â€“ Track standups, retros, and bug tracker use as Scrum evidence.
