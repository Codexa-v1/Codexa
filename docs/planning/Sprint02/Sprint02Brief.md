# 🚀 Sprint 2 Brief — Codexa Event Planning App
 
**Scrum Master:** Given  
**Sprint Goal:** Deliver core functionality of the Event Planning system, while ensuring testing, feedback, and documentation processes are in place.  

---

## 🎯 Focus Areas

1. **Core Features (25%)**  
   - Implement event creation with automatic status updates.  
   - Guest management (upload/download guest lists).  
   - Vendor management (compare vendors by availability and affordability).  
   - Event scheduling (time slots, exportable as PDF/CSV).  
   - File uploads/downloads (floorplans, documents).  
   - Calendar integration (create events from clicking on the calendar).  
   - Vendor browsing & management page.  
   - Maintain stability (at most one non-severe bug).  

2. **Automated Testing (10%)**  
   - Implement **UI** and **API** testing.  
   - Ensure tests are stable, relevant, and integrated into workflows.  

3. **Stakeholder Reviews (10%)**  
   - Meet with stakeholders (Students, lecturers, tutors, “clients”).  
   - Record feedback and integrate into development.  

4. **API Integration (15%)**  
   - Integrate at least one **external API**.  
   - Expose our own API for external use (mutually beneficial with other groups).  

5. **User Feedback (10%)**  
   - Conduct user testing with friends, family, and peers.  
   - Collect feedback formally and integrate changes.  

6. **Project Management (10%)**  
   - Continue Agile/Scrum practices.  
   - Evidence through standups, retrospectives, Trello/GitHub updates.  

7. **Bug Tracking (5%)**  
   - Use **GitHub Issues** (and/or Trello) to log and track bugs.  

8. **Database Documentation (5%)**  
   - Provide schema diagrams, deployment info, and rationale for design choices.  

9. **Third-Party Code Documentation (5%)**  
   - Document integrations (Auth0, Mongoose, Tailwind, etc.).  
   - Justify their use in the project.  

10. **Testing Documentation (5%)**  
   - Explain testing process (manual, automated, user testing).  
   - Show integration of user feedback into development.

## 📝 Deliverables by End of Sprint 2
- A working version of the **core features** listed above.  
- Evidence of **testing**, **stakeholder input**, and **user feedback**.  
- Updated **documentation** for backend, database, and third-party code.  
- Project management artifacts (Trello board, GitHub Issues, standup notes).  
- A stable, partially deployable app (backend deployed, frontend in progress).

## 📅 Next Steps
- Finalise backlog for Sprint 2.  
- Assign roles and tasks.  
- Begin implementation of features + testing strategy.  
- Schedule stakeholder and user testing sessions.
