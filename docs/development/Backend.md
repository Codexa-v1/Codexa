# Backend Explained

## Overview
Our backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, which provides routing capabilities. The backend forms one of the three main parts of our project:
- **Frontend** ‚Üí where users interact with the application.
- **API Layer** ‚Üí defines functions that connect the frontend to the backend.
- **Backend** ‚Üí handles routing logic and connects to the database.

When a request is made, the flow looks like this:  
**Frontend ‚Üí API Layer ‚Üí Backend (routes) ‚Üí Database**

## Database and Models
We use **MongoDB Atlas** as our database, connected via **Mongoose**, which allows us to define schemas and models. Schemas enforce structure on the data stored in collections, ensuring uniformity across entries. Models are the building blocks of the data we query, create, update, and delete.

Currently, we have five main collections (subject to change as development progresses):

- **events** ‚Üí stores details about events (date, time, description, etc.)
- **guests** ‚Üí stores information about guests (name, email, phone, etc.)
- **vendors** ‚Üí stores information about vendors (business details, services, etc.)
- **eventguests** ‚Üí links guests to specific events using `guestId` and `eventId`
- **eventvendors** ‚Üí links vendors to specific events using `vendorId` and `eventId`

This design allows us to manage many-to-many relationships between events and both guests and vendors.

## API and Routes
Our routes, built with **Express.js**, define how data is sent and retrieved from the database. These include CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) across our collections. The API layer ensures the frontend communicates seamlessly with these routes.

---

## Authentication 
We are using **Auth0** for authentication and authorization. This ensures secure login, token-based authentication, and role-based access control.

- **SPA (Frontend)** ‚Üí Uses `@auth0/auth0-react` for handling login/logout, token retrieval, and redirects.
- **Backend (API)** ‚Üí Uses Auth0-issued JWT tokens to verify requests, with audience and issuer checks enabled.
- **Allowed URLs** ‚Üí Auth0 configured with callback, logout, and web origins for both localhost (development) and Azure production domains.
- **Environment variables**:
  - Frontend: `VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE`  
    ‚Üí injected at build time via GitHub Secrets.
  - Backend: `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`  
    ‚Üí stored securely in Azure App Service Configuration.

üîê **Security note:** Secrets are never stored in the repo. SPA keys are safe to expose (domain, clientId, audience) but API secrets remain on the server side.

---

## Testing
We plan to implement both **unit tests** (for models and API endpoints) and **integration tests** to ensure the backend interacts properly with the database. Postman is currently used for manual testing of routes.

---

## Deployment
We deploy the system in two parts:

- **Frontend (Vite + React SPA)** ‚Üí Hosted on **Azure Static Web Apps**  
  - Deployed via GitHub Actions workflow.  
  - Handles SPA routing with `staticwebapp.config.json` to redirect all paths to `index.html`.  
  - Uses environment variables (`VITE_*`) injected at build time.

- **Backend (Node/Express API)** ‚Üí Hosted on **Azure App Service (Linux)**  
  - Deployed via a separate GitHub Actions workflow using an App Service publish profile.  
  - Configured with environment variables (Auth0, DB connection, CORS origins).  
  - CORS enabled to allow only requests from the SPA domain.

- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**  
  - Automated build and deploy pipelines for both frontend and backend.  
  - Workflows fetch environment variables from GitHub Secrets.  
  - Any push to `main` triggers deployment.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues faced & resolutions**:
1. **GitHub Actions build failed** due to relative path imports ‚Üí fixed using Vite `@` alias pointing to `src/`.  
2. **Handling Auth0 secrets safely** ‚Üí moved SPA config to GitHub Secrets (`VITE_*`) and API secrets into Azure App Service settings.
