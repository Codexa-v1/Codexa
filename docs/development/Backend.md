# Backend Explained

## üî¨ Overview
Our backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, which provides routing capabilities. The backend forms one of the three main parts of our project:
- **Frontend** ‚Üí where users interact with the application.
- **API Layer** ‚Üí defines functions that connect the frontend to the backend.
- **Backend** ‚Üí handles routing logic and connects to the database.

When a request is made, the flow looks like this:  
**Frontend ‚Üí API Layer ‚Üí Backend (routes) ‚Üí Database**

## üìà Database and Models
For our database system, we decided to use **MongoDB** as our database. The reason for 
this lies in the way in which one can specify how exactly data will be stored in the 
database for different **collections**, using models. **Models** are pieces of code where one 
specifies what fields an object will have, for instance, for a guest a model would have 
information such as name, surname, contact details, etc. This would be the structure of all 
guests for our application, and so by using models we can ensure consistency in how we 
send and receive data from the database. Furthermore, we can add whichever fields we 
desire for models that we are planning to use, making models a good choice to store fine
tuned data in our database

We used eight different schemas for our models, namely: event, guest, vendor, venue, 
eventguest, eventvendor, eventguest, eventschedule

- The **Event model** has information that we keep on a specific event

```bash
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const eventSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    eventPlanner: { type: String, required: true }, // This is to keep track of the Auth0 token of the person who created the event
    title: { type: String, required: true },
    date: { type: Date, required: true },
    endDate: { type: Date, required: true },
    location: { type: String, required: true },
    description: { type: String, required: true },
    status: { 
        type: String, 
        enum: ['Planned', 'Ongoing', 'Completed', 'Cancelled'], 
        default: 'Planned' 
    },
    budget: {
        type: Number,
        required: true
    },
    capacity: Number,
    category: { type: String, required: true },
    organizer: {
        name: String,
        contact: String,
        email: String
    },
    startTime: { type: String, required: true },
    endTime: { type: String, required: true },
    floorplan: { type: String, required: true }, // url to a picture of the floorplans
    rsvpCurrent: { type: Number, default: 0 },
    rsvpTotal: { type: Number, default: 0 }
}, {timestamps: true});

eventSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
    if (this.category && typeof this.category === 'string') {
        this.category = this.category.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + this.category.slice(1).toLowerCase();
    }
    next();
});

const Event = mongoose.model("Event", eventSchema);

export default Event;
```

- The **Guest model** has information that we keep on a specific guest.

```bash
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const guest = new mongoose.Schema({
  // for id, just use the automatically created field in mongo
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  phone: { type: String, required: true },
  eventId: { type: String, required: true },
  rsvpStatus: { type: String, enum: ['Pending', 'Accepted', 'Declined'], default: 'Pending', required: true },
  dietaryPreferences: { type: String, default: '' },
}, { timestamps: true});

const Guest = mongoose.model('Guest', guest);

export default Guest;
```

- The **Eventguest model** keeps the ID of the guest created together with the ID of the 
event the guest was created in ‚Äì this results in a collection which allows us to get all the 
guests in a particular event.

```bash
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const eventGuestSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    eventId: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'Event',
        required: true
    },
    guestId: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'Guest',
        required: true
    },
    rsvpStatus: {
        type: String,
        enum: ['Pending', 'Accepted', 'Declined'],
        default: 'Pending'
    },
    customNotes: { type: String },
    invitationSent: { type: Boolean, default: false }
}, { timestamps: true });

const EventGuest = mongoose.model('EventGuest', eventGuestSchema);
export default EventGuest;
```

- The **Vendor model** has information that we keep on a specific vendor.

```bash
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const vendorSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: { type: String, required: true },
    vendorType: { type: String, required: true },
    contactPerson: { type: String, required: true },
    phone: { type: String, required: true },
    email: { type: String, required: true },
    website: String,
    address: { type: String, required: true },
    rating: {type: Number, min: 1, max: 5},
    notes: { type: String }
}, { timestamps: true });

const Vendor = mongoose.model("Vendor", vendorSchema);

export default Vendor;
```

- The **Eventvendor model** keeps the ID of the vendor created together with the ID of the 
event the vendor was created in ‚Äì this results in a collection which allows us to get all the 
vendors for a particular event.

```bash
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const eventVendorSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    eventId: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'Event',
        required: true
    },
    vendorId: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'Vendor',
        required: true
    },
    // Optional: Add fields for contract details, status, etc.
    contractDetails: {
        type: String
    },
    status: {
        type: String,
        enum: ['Pending', 'Confirmed', 'Completed', 'Cancelled'],
        default: 'Pending'
    },
}, {timestamps: true});

const EventVendor = mongoose.model('EventVendor', eventVendorSchema);
export default EventVendor;
```

- The **Venue model** has information that we keep on a specific venue.

```bash
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const eventSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    venueName: { type: String, required: true },
    venueAddress: { type: String, required: true },
    venueEmail: { type: String, required: true },
    venuePhone: { type: String, required: true },
    capacity: { type: Number, required: true },
    venueStatus: { type: String, required: true },
    venueImage: { type: String }, // Optional
}, {timestamps: true});

const Venue = mongoose.model("Venue", eventSchema);

export default Venue;
```

- The **Eventvenue model** keeps the ID of the venue created together with the ID of the 
event the venue was created in ‚Äì this results in a collection which allows us to get all the 
venues for a particular event.

```bash
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const eventVenueSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    eventId: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'Event',
        required: true
    },
    venueId: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'Venue',
        required: true
    },
    // Optional: Add fields for contract details, status, etc.
    contractDetails: {
        type: String
    },
    status: {
        type: String,
        enum: ['Pending', 'Confirmed', 'Completed', 'Cancelled'],
        default: 'Pending'
    },
}, {timestamps: true});

const EventVenue = mongoose.model('EventVenue', eventVenueSchema);
export default EventVenue;
```

- The **Eventschedule** model has information on the schedules that a specific event will 
have

```bash
// A schedule object will simply have start-time, end-time, and some field to describe what will be happening between the two times
// An event will therefore have many schedule objects

import mongoose from "mongoose";

const scheduleSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  eventId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Event", required: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true },
  startTime: { type: String, required: true },
  endTime: { type: String, required: true }
}, { timestamps: true });

const Schedule = mongoose.model("Schedule", scheduleSchema);

export default Schedule;
```

## üöÄ Deployment
We chose **Microsoft Azure** for deployment because:  
- **Seamless GitHub Integration** ‚Üí Built-in GitHub Actions support makes CI/CD pipelines easier to set up and maintain.  
- **Free/Student-friendly Tiers** ‚Üí Azure provides free hosting credits and student benefits (via GitHub Student Developer Pack), reducing deployment costs.  
- **Separation of Concerns** ‚Üí Azure allows us to host the **frontend (Static Web Apps)** and **backend (App Service)** independently, ensuring scalability and clear architecture.  
- **Environment Variables & Secrets Management** ‚Üí Azure App Service configuration ensures sensitive data (DB connections, Auth0 secrets) remain secure and out of source control.   
- **Scalability** ‚Üí Both Static Web Apps and App Service can scale automatically as traffic increases, ensuring reliability.  

We deploy the system in two parts:

- **Frontend (Vite + React SPA)** ‚Üí Hosted on **Azure Static Web Apps**  
  - Deployed via GitHub Actions workflow.  
  - Handles SPA routing with `staticwebapp.config.json` to redirect all paths to `index.html`.  
  - Uses environment variables (`VITE_*`) injected at build time.

- **Backend (Node/Express API)** ‚Üí Hosted on **Azure App Service (Linux)**  
  - Deployed via a separate GitHub Actions workflow using an App Service publish profile.  
  - Configured with environment variables (Auth0, DB connection, CORS origins).  
  - CORS enabled to allow only requests from the SPA domain.

- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**  
  - Automated build and deploy pipelines for both frontend and backend.  
  - Workflows fetch environment variables from GitHub Secrets.  
  - Any push to `main` triggers deployment.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues faced & resolutions**:
1. **GitHub Actions build failed** due to relative path imports ‚Üí fixed using Vite `@` alias pointing to `src/`.  
2. **Handling Auth0 secrets safely** ‚Üí moved SPA config to GitHub Secrets (`VITE_*`) and API secrets into Azure App Service settings.
