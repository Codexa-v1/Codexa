# Methodologies

## Agile Scrum

We follow the Agile Scrum methodology to ensure adaptive planning, early delivery, and continuous improvement:

- **Standups:** Held on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays to sync up on progress and blockers.
- **Sprint Retrospectives:** Conducted after every sprint to reflect on what went well and what can be improved.
- **Role Rotation:** Team roles (e.g., Scrum Master, Product Owner) rotate every sprint to share responsibilities and perspectives.

## GitHub Flow

Our source control process follows the GitHub Flow to maintain code quality and smooth deployment:

- The **main** (or **master**) branch is always deployable and reflects production-ready code.
- Development happens on short-lived **feature branches** created off main.
- When a feature is complete, a **Pull Request (PR)** is opened.
- The PR undergoes **peer review** and must be **approved** before merging.
- Once approved, the feature branch is **merged into main**.
- The main branch triggers **deployment** to production.
